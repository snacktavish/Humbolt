	abstract = {Using simulated data, we compared five methods of phylogenetic tree estimation: parsimony, compatibility, maximum likelihood, Fitch-Margoliash, and neighbor joining. For each combination of substitution rates and sequence length, 100 data sets were generated for each of 50 trees, for a total of 5,000 replications per condition. Accuracy was measured by two measures of the distance between the true tree and the estimate of the tree, one measure sensitive to accuracy of branch lengths and the other not. The distance-matrix methods (Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining) performed best when they were constrained from estimating negative branch lengths; all comparisons with other methods used this constraint. Parsimony and compatibility had similar results, with compatibility generally inferior; Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining had similar results, with neighbor joining generally slightly inferior. Maximum likelihood was the most successful method overall, although for short sequences Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining were sometimes better. Bias of the estimates was inferred by measuring whether the independent estimates of a tree for different data sets were closer to the true tree than to each other. Parsimony and compatibility had particular difficulty with inaccuracy and bias when substitution rates varied among different branches. When rates of evolution varied among different sites, all methods showed signs of inaccuracy and bias.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of large numbers of sequences is demanding and the computational burden is further increased by downstream analyses depending on these alignments. With the abundance of sequence data, an integrative approach of adding new sequences to existing alignments without their full re-computation and maintaining the relative matching of existing sequences is an attractive option. Another current challenge is the extension of reference alignments with fragmented sequences, as those coming from next-generation metagenomics, that contain relatively little information. Widely used methods for alignment extension are based on profile representation of reference sequences. These do not incorporate and use phylogenetic information and are affected by the composition of the reference alignment and the phylogenetic positions of query sequences.
Results: We have developed a method for phylogeny-aware alignment of partial-order sequence graphs and apply it here to the extension of alignments with new data. Our new method, called {PAGAN}, infers ancestral sequences for the reference alignment and adds new sequences in their phylogenetic context, either to predefined positions or by finding the best placement for sequences of unknown origin. Unlike profile-based alternatives, {PAGAN} considers the phylogenetic relatedness of the sequences and is not affected by inclusion of more diverged sequences in the reference set. Our analyses show that {PAGAN} outperforms alternative methods for alignment extension and provides superior accuracy for both {DNA} and protein data, the improvement being especially large for fragmented sequences. Moreover, {PAGAN-generated} alignments of noisy next-generation sequencing ({NGS)} sequences are accurate enough for the use of {RNA-seq} data in evolutionary analyses.

	abstract = {The Multiple Sequence Alignment ({MSA)} is a computational abstraction that represents a partial summary either of indel history, or of structural similarity. Taking the former view (indel history), it is possible to use formal automata theory to generalize the phylogenetic likelihood framework for finite substitution models (Dayhoff's probability matrices and Felsenstein's pruning algorithm) to arbitrary-length sequences. In this paper, we report results of a simulation-based benchmark of several methods for reconstruction of indel history. The methods tested include a relatively new algorithm for statistical marginalization of {MSAs} that sums over a stochastically-sampled ensemble of the most probable evolutionary histories. For mammalian evolutionary parameters on several different trees, the single most likely history sampled by our algorithm appears less biased than histories reconstructed by other {MSA} methods. The algorithm can also be used for alignment-free inference, where the {MSA} is explicitly summed out of the analysis. As an illustration of our method, we discuss reconstruction of the evolutionary histories of human protein-coding genes.},

This problem is exacerbated by the exclusion of codon-based models from commonly employed model selection techniques, presumably due to the computational cost associated with codon models. We investigated an efficient alternative to standard nucleotide substitution models, in which codon position ({CP)} is incorporated into the model. We determined the most appropriate model for alignments of 177 {RNA} virus genes and 106 yeast genes, using 11 substitution models including one codon model and four {CP} models. The majority of analyzed gene alignments are best described by {CP} substitution models, rather than by standard nucleotide models, and without the computational cost of full codon models. These results have significant implications for phylogenetic inference of coding sequences as they make it clear that substitution models incorporating {CPs} not only are a computationally realistic alternative to standard models but may also frequently be statistically superior.},

	abstract = {Background
We recently described {FastTree}, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to {FastTree} that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability.

{Methodology/Principal} Findings
Where {FastTree} 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges ({NNIs)} and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, {FastTree} 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting ({SPRs)} and maximum-likelihood {NNIs.} {FastTree} 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the {“CAT”} approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, {FastTree} 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood {NNIs} ({PhyML} 3 with default settings). Although {FastTree} 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood {SPRs}, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, {FastTree} 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. {FastTree} 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct {16S} ribosomal {RNAs} on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

{Conclusions/Significance}
{FastTree} 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. {FastTree} 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

	abstract = {Gene families are growing rapidly, but standard methods for inferring phylogenies do not scale to alignments with over 10,000 sequences. We present {FastTree}, a method for constructing large phylogenies and for estimating their reliability. Instead of storing a distance matrix, {FastTree} stores sequence profiles of internal nodes in the tree. {FastTree} uses these profiles to implement Neighbor-Joining and uses heuristics to quickly identify candidate joins. {FastTree} then uses nearest neighbor interchanges to reduce the length of the tree. For an alignment with N sequences, L sites, and a different characters, a distance matrix requires O(N2) space and O({N2L)} time, but {FastTree} requires just O({NLa} + N) memory and O(Nlog ({N)La)} time. To estimate the tree's reliability, {FastTree} uses local bootstrapping, which gives another 100-fold speedup over a distance matrix. For example, {FastTree} computed a tree and support values for 158,022 distinct {16S} ribosomal {RNAs} in 17 h and 2.4 {GB} of memory. Just computing pairwise {Jukes–Cantor} distances and storing them, without inferring a tree or bootstrapping, would require 17 h and 50 {GB} of memory. In simulations, {FastTree} was slightly more accurate than Neighbor-Joining, {BIONJ}, or {FastME;} on genuine alignments, {FastTree's} topologies had higher likelihoods. {FastTree} is available at http://microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the {BLAST} programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped {BLAST} program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by {BLAST} into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated {BLAST} ({PSI-BLAST)} program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped {BLAST}, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. {PSI-BLAST} is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the {BRCT} superfamily.},

Here, we define a simple index that measures the contribution made by different species to phylogenetic diversity and show how the index might contribute towards species-based conservation priorities. We describe procedures to control for missing species, incomplete phylogenetic resolution and uncertainty in node ages that make it possible to apply the method in poorly known clades. We also show that the index is independent of clade size in phylogenies of more than 100 species, indicating that scores from unrelated taxonomic groups are likely to be comparable. Similar scores are returned under two different species concepts, suggesting that the index is robust to taxonomic changes. The approach is applied to a near-complete species-level phylogeny of the Mammalia to generate a global priority list incorporating both phylogenetic diversity and extinction risk. The 100 highest-ranking species represent a high proportion of total mammalian diversity and include many species not usually recognised as conservation priorities. Many species that are both evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered ({EDGE} species) do not benefit from existing conservation projects or protected areas. The results suggest that global conservation priorities may have to be reassessed in order to prevent a disproportionately large amount of mammalian evolutionary history becoming extinct in the near future.},

A method for simulating a mapping from the posterior distribution of mappings is also presented, and the utility of the method is illustrated on two previously published data sets.

In addition to these broad evolutionary questions there is increasing awareness of the importance of large phylogenies for addressing conservation issues such as biodiversity hotspots and response to global change. Two major classes of methods have been employed to accomplish the large tree-building task: supertrees and supermatrices.

	abstract = {The enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica is one of the leading causes of foodborne illness in the world. The species is extremely diverse, containing more than 2,500 named serovars that are designated for their unique antigen characters and pathogenicity profiles—some are known to be virulent pathogens, while others are not. Questions regarding the evolution of pathogenicity, significance of antigen characters, diversity of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat ({CRISPR)} loci, among others, will remain elusive until a strong evolutionary framework is established. We present the first large-scale S. enterica subsp. enterica phylogeny inferred from a new reference-free k-mer approach of gathering single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs)} from whole genomes. The phylogeny of 156 isolates representing 78 serovars (102 were newly sequenced) reveals two major lineages, each with many strongly supported sublineages. One of these lineages is the S. Typhi group; well nested within the phylogeny. Lineage-through-time analyses suggest there have been two instances of accelerated rates of diversification within the subspecies. We also found that antigen characters and {CRISPR} loci reveal different evolutionary patterns than that of the phylogeny, suggesting that a horizontal gene transfer or possibly a shared environmental acquisition might have influenced the present character distribution. Our study also shows the ability to extract reference-free {SNPs} from a large set of genomes and then to use these {SNPs} for phylogenetic reconstruction. This automated, annotation-free approach is an important step forward for bacterial disease tracking and in efficiently elucidating the evolutionary history of highly clonal organisms.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference provides an appealing general framework for phylogenetic analysis, able to incorporate a wide variety of modeling assumptions and to provide a coherent treatment of uncertainty. Existing computational approaches to Bayesian inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC)} have not, however, kept pace with the scale of the data analysis problems in phylogenetics, and this has hindered the adoption of Bayesian methods. In this paper, we present an alternative to {MCMC} based on Sequential Monte Carlo ({SMC).} We develop an extension of classical {SMC} based on partially ordered sets and show how to apply this framework—which we refer to as {PosetSMC—to} phylogenetic analysis. We provide a theoretical treatment of {PosetSMC} and also present experimental evaluation of {PosetSMC} on both synthetic and real data. The empirical results demonstrate that {PosetSMC} is a very promising alternative to {MCMC}, providing up to two orders of magnitude faster convergence. We discuss other factors favorable to the adoption of {PosetSMC} in phylogenetics, including its ability to estimate marginal likelihoods, its ready implementability on parallel and distributed computing platforms, and the possibility of combining with {MCMC} in hybrid {MCMC–SMC} schemes. Software for {PosetSMC} is available at http://www.stat.ubc.ca/ {bouchard/PosetSMC.}},

	abstract = {Summary: New sequence data useful for phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses continues to be added to public databases. The construction of multiple sequence alignments and inference of huge phylogenies comprising large taxonomic groups are expensive tasks, both in terms of man hours and computational resources. Therefore, maintaining comprehensive phylogenies, based on representative and up-to-date molecular sequences, is challenging.
{PUmPER} is a framework that can perpetually construct multi-gene alignments (with {PHLAWD)} and phylogenetic trees (with {ExaML} or {RAxML-Light)} for a given {NCBI} taxonomic group. When sufficient numbers of new gene sequences for the selected taxonomic group have accumulated in {GenBank}, {PUmPER} automatically extends the alignment and infers extended phylogenetic trees by using previously inferred smaller trees as starting topologies.
Using our framework, large phylogenetic trees can be perpetually updated without human intervention. Importantly, resulting phylogenies are not statistically significantly worse than trees inferred from scratch.
Availability and Implementation: {PUmPER} can run in stand-alone mode on a single server, or offload the computationally expensive phylogenetic searches to a parallel computing cluster. Source code, documentation, and tutorials are available at https://github.com/fizquierdo/perpetually-updated-trees.

Results: We describe {RAxML-Light}, a tool for large-scale phylogenetic inference on supercomputers under maximum likelihood. It implements a light-weight checkpointing mechanism, deploys 128-bit ({SSE3)} and 256-bit ({AVX)} vector intrinsics, offers two orthogonal memory saving techniques and provides a fine-grain production-level message passing interface parallelization of the likelihood function. To demonstrate scalability and robustness of the code, we inferred a phylogeny on a simulated {DNA} alignment (1481 taxa, 20 000 000 bp) using 672 cores. This dataset requires one terabyte of {RAM} to compute the likelihood score on a single tree.

On datasets ≥4000 taxa it also runs 2–3 times faster than {GARLI.} {RAxML} has been parallelized with {MPI} to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute {ML} trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25 057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51 089 bp) taxa, respectively.

	abstract = {Character mapping on phylogenies has played an important, if not critical role, in our understanding of molecular, morphological, and behavioral evolution. Until very recently we have relied on parsimony to infer character changes. Parsimony has a number of serious limitations that are drawbacks to our understanding. Recent statistical methods have been developed that free us from these limitations enabling us to overcome the problems of parsimony by accommodating uncertainty in evolutionary time, ancestral states, and the phylogeny.

	abstract = {Many questions in evolutionary biology are best addressed by comparing traits in different species. Often such studies involve mapping characters on phylogenetic trees. Mapping characters on trees allows the nature, number, and timing of the transformations to be identified. The parsimony method is the only method available for mapping morphological characters on phylogenies. Although the parsimony method often makes reasonable reconstructions of the history of a character, it has a number of limitations. These limitations include the inability to consider more than a single change along a branch on a tree and the uncoupling of evolutionary time from amount of character change. We extended a method described by Nielsen (2002, Syst. Biol. 51:729–739) to the mapping of morphological characters under continuous-time Markov models and demonstrate here the utility of the method for mapping characters on trees and for identifying character correlation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Rates of phenotypic evolution have changed throughout the history of life, producing variation in levels of morphological, functional, and ecological diversity among groups. Testing for the presence of these rate shifts is a key component of evaluating hypotheses about what causes them. In this paper, general predictions regarding changes in phenotypic diversity as a function of evolutionary history and rates are developed, and tests are derived to evaluate rate changes. Simulations show that these tests are more powerful than existing tests using standardized contrasts. The new approaches are distributed in an application called Brownie and in r8s.},
