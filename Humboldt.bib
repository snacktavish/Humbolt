Existing computational approaches to Bayesian inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC)} have not, however, kept pace with the scale of the data analysis problems in phylogenetics, and this has hindered the adoption of Bayesian methods. In this paper, we present an alternative to {MCMC} based on Sequential Monte Carlo ({SMC).} We develop an extension of classical {SMC} based on partially ordered sets and show how to apply this framework—which we refer to as {PosetSMC—to} phylogenetic analysis. We provide a theoretical treatment of {PosetSMC} and also present experimental evaluation of {PosetSMC} on both synthetic and real data. The empirical results demonstrate that {PosetSMC} is a very promising alternative to {MCMC}, providing up to two orders of magnitude faster convergence. We discuss other factors favorable to the adoption of {PosetSMC} in phylogenetics, including its ability to estimate marginal likelihoods, its ready implementability on parallel and distributed computing platforms, and the possibility of combining with {MCMC} in hybrid {MCMC–SMC} schemes. Software for {PosetSMC} is available at http://www.stat.ubc.ca/ {bouchard/PosetSMC.}},

The details of the maximum likelihood method will depend on the details of the probabilistic model of evolution assumed. There are a very large number of possible models of evolution. For a few of the simpler models, the calculation of the likelihood of an evolutionary tree is outlined. For these models, the maximum likelihood tree will be the same as the “most parsimonious” (or minimum-steps) tree if the probability of change during the evolution of the group is assumed a priori to be very small. However, most sets of data require too many assumed state changes per character to be compatible with this assumption. Farris (1973) has argued that maximum likelihood and parsimony methods are identical under a much less restrictive set of assumptions. It is argued that the present methods are preferable to his, and a counterexample to his argument is presented. An algorithm which enables rapid calculation of the likelihood of a phylogeny is described.},

However, simulation studies are also subject to several sources of bias that make the results of different simulation studies difficult to interpret and often contradictory. In this study, I examined the performance of 26 commonly used methods of phylogenetic inference for three statistical criteria: consistency, efficiency, and robustness. Methods examined included parsimony (general, weighted, and transversion), maximum likelihood (assuming Jukes-Cantor and Kimura models of {DNA} substitution), and {UPGMA}, minimum evolution, and weighted and unweighted least squares (with uncorrected, Jukes-Cantor, Kimura, modified Kimura, and gamma distances). The performance of methods was examined under three models of {DNA} substitution for four taxa. The branch lengths of the four-taxon trees were varied extensively in this simulation. The results indicate that most methods perform well (i.e., estimate the correct tree 2:95\% of the time) over a large portion of the four-taxon parameter space. In general, maximum likelihood performed best, followed by the additive distance methods and the parsimony methods. Lake's method of invariants and {UPGMA} are, respectively, inefficient and extremely sensitive to branch-length inequalities. In general, differential weighting of character-state transformations increases the performance of methods when the weighting can be applied appropriately. Although methods differ in their consistency, efficiency, and robustness, additional criteria-mainly falsifiability-are extremely important considerations when choosing a method of phylogenetic inference.},

Mapping characters on trees allows the nature, number, and timing of the transformations to be identified. The parsimony method is the only method available for mapping morphological characters on phylogenies. Although the parsimony method often makes reasonable reconstructions of the history of a character, it has a number of limitations. These limitations include the inability to consider more than a single change along a branch on a tree and the uncoupling of evolutionary time from amount of character change. We extended a method described by Nielsen (2002, Syst. Biol. 51:729–739) to the mapping of morphological characters under continuous-time Markov models and demonstrate here the utility of the method for mapping characters on trees and for identifying character correlation.},

For each combination of substitution rates and sequence length, 100 data sets were generated for each of 50 trees, for a total of 5,000 replications per condition. Accuracy was measured by two measures of the distance between the true tree and the estimate of the tree, one measure sensitive to accuracy of branch lengths and the other not. The distance-matrix methods (Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining) performed best when they were constrained from estimating negative branch lengths; all comparisons with other methods used this constraint. Parsimony and compatibility had similar results, with compatibility generally inferior; Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining had similar results, with neighbor joining generally slightly inferior. Maximum likelihood was the most successful method overall, although for short sequences Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining were sometimes better. Bias of the estimates was inferred by measuring whether the independent estimates of a tree for different data sets were closer to the true tree than to each other. Parsimony and compatibility had particular difficulty with inaccuracy and bias when substitution rates varied among different branches. When rates of evolution varied among different sites, all methods showed signs of inaccuracy and bias.},

However, the common approaches for mapping mutations based on parsimony have lacked a solid statistical foundation. Here, I present a Bayesian method for mapping mutations on a phylogeny. I illustrate some of the common problems associated with using parsimony and suggest instead that inferences in molecular evolution can be made on the basis of the posterior distribution of the mappings of mutations. A method for simulating a mapping from the posterior distribution of mappings is also presented, and the utility of the method is illustrated on two previously published data sets. Applications include a method for testing for variation in the substitution rate along the sequence and a method for testing whether the {dN/dS} ratio varies among lineages in the phylogeny.},

	abstract = {Gene families are growing rapidly, but standard methods for inferring phylogenies do not scale to alignments with over 10,000 sequences. We present {FastTree}, a method for constructing large phylogenies and for estimating their reliability. Instead of storing a distance matrix, {FastTree} stores sequence profiles of internal nodes in the tree. {FastTree} uses these profiles to implement Neighbor-Joining and uses heuristics to quickly identify candidate joins. {FastTree} then uses nearest neighbor interchanges to reduce the length of the tree. For an alignment with N sequences, L sites, and a different characters, a distance matrix requires O(N2) space and O({N2L)} time, but {FastTree} requires just O({NLa} + N) memory and O(Nlog ({N)La)} time. To estimate the tree's reliability, {FastTree} uses local bootstrapping, which gives another 100-fold speedup over a distance matrix. For example, {FastTree} computed a tree and support values for 158,022 distinct {16S} ribosomal {RNAs} in 17 h and 2.4 {GB} of memory. Just computing pairwise {Jukes–Cantor} distances and storing them, without inferring a tree or bootstrapping, would require 17 h and 50 {GB} of memory. In simulations, {FastTree} was slightly more accurate than Neighbor-Joining, {BIONJ}, or {FastME;} on genuine alignments, {FastTree's} topologies had higher likelihoods. {FastTree} is available at http://microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

	abstract = {Background
We recently described {FastTree}, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to {FastTree} that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability.

{Methodology/Principal} Findings
Where {FastTree} 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges ({NNIs)} and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, {FastTree} 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting ({SPRs)} and maximum-likelihood {NNIs.} {FastTree} 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the {“CAT”} approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, {FastTree} 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood {NNIs} ({PhyML} 3 with default settings). Although {FastTree} 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood {SPRs}, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, {FastTree} 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. {FastTree} 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct {16S} ribosomal {RNAs} on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

{Conclusions/Significance}
{FastTree} 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. {FastTree} 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

In plants, it has been suggested that life history traits are correlated with the rate of molecular evolution, but previous studies have yielded conflicting results. Exceptionally large phylogenies of five major angiosperm clades demonstrate that rates of molecular evolution are consistently low in trees and shrubs, with relatively long generation times, as compared with related herbaceous plants, which generally have shorter generation times. Herbs show much higher rates of molecular change but also much higher variance in rates. Correlates of life history attributes have long been of interest to biologists, and our results demonstrate how changes in the rate of molecular evolution that are linked to life history traits can affect measurements of the tempo of evolution as well as our ability to identify and conserve biodiversity.},

It implements a light-weight checkpointing mechanism, deploys 128-bit ({SSE3)} and 256-bit ({AVX)} vector intrinsics, offers two orthogonal memory saving techniques and provides a fine-grain production-level message passing interface parallelization of the likelihood function. To demonstrate scalability and robustness of the code, we inferred a phylogeny on a simulated {DNA} alignment (1481 taxa, 20 000 000 bp) using 672 cores. This dataset requires one terabyte of {RAM} to compute the likelihood score on a single tree.

	abstract = {Summary: {RAxML-VI-HPC} (randomized axelerated maximum likelihood for high performance computing) is a sequential and parallel program for inference of large phylogenies with maximum likelihood ({ML).} Low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the {GTR+CAT} approximation as replacement for {GTR+Γ} yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous version of {RAxML.} A large-scale performance comparison with {GARLI}, {PHYML}, {IQPNNI} and {MrBayes} on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that {RAxML} requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program ({GARLI)} on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets ≥4000 taxa it also runs 2–3 times faster than {GARLI.} {RAxML} has been parallelized with {MPI} to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute {ML} trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25 057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51 089 bp) taxa, respectively.

	abstract = {Scientists rarely reuse expert knowledge of phylogeny, in spite of years of
						effort to assemble a great {“Tree} of Life” ({ToL).} A notable
						exception involves the use of Phylomatic, which provides tools to
						generate custom phylogenies from a large, pre-computed, expert phylogeny of
						plant taxa. This suggests great potential for a more generalized system
						that, starting with a query consisting of a list of any known species, would
						rectify non-standard names, identify expert phylogenies containing the
						implicated taxa, prune away unneeded parts, and supply branch lengths and
						annotations, resulting in a custom phylogeny suited to the user’s
						needs. Such a system could become a sustainable community resource if
						implemented as a distributed system of loosely coupled parts that interact
						through clearly defined interfaces.
